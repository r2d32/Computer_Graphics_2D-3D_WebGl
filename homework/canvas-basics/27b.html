<!-- This is a simple, bare-bones canvas web page template.
     Its sole purpose is to save you a little typing when
     starting up a new web page that uses the canvas element. -->
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Edit the title of this canvas page!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- No further elements here; strictly minimalist.
             But of course you may resize your canvas as needed. -->
        <canvas id="canvas" width="180" height="180" style="border: solid #e0e0dc; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; margin: 60px">
            Sorry, but you need a web browser that supports the
            <code>canvas</code> element.
        </canvas>
